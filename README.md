## 🚀 About EditX

EditX is not just a UI mock-up—it’s the control center for the entire editing workflow.

Think of it as the cockpit of an aircraft 🛩.
Every action—drawing, editing, scaling, transforming—will happen here.
This frontend UI is designed to mirror professional CAD software while being lightweight, modern, and extendable.

👉 While the backend and full editing functionality are coming soon, this UI is the heart of the project.
A strong UI/UX layer is where real innovation starts, and EditX makes sure the experience is smooth, intuitive, and powerful.



## ✨ Key Highlights

🖥 Top Toolbar – Like industry CAD tools (File, Save, Undo, Zoom, Settings).

🎯 Sidebar Tools – Line, Circle, Rectangle, Polygon, Text, Move, Rotate, Scale.

📐 Canvas – CAD-style dark grid with crosshair guidelines.

📊 Status Bar – Real-time info panel (coordinates, FPS, dx/dy).

⚡ Designed for Extension – Backend + advanced editing features will plug right in.

## 🧩 Why This Matters

UI is not just “the look”—
it’s the foundation of how people interact with the system.

This editing interface:
✅ Defines the user’s first impression
✅ Makes editing intuitive and efficient
✅ Becomes the distinguishing factor that separates this project from ordinary tools

When the backend plugs in, this UI will transform into a powerful full-scale editing engine.

## 🛠 Roadmap

✅ Build CAD-style editing UI (this repo)

🔲 Add backend integration (shape storage, editing logic)

🔲 Advanced tools (pan/zoom, snapping, constraints)

🔲 Export/import support
